# Backtest Tab — Implementation Plan

## What was built

### New file: `Backtest/backtest.py`
All computation logic lives here. The Streamlit tab calls these functions; nothing touches the DB.

**`get_split_dates()`**
Returns `(train_start, train_end, test_start, test_end)` based on today's date.
- Test period = most recent 1 calendar year
- Train period = 4 years before that

**`run_backtest(sym_a, sym_b, window=90)`**
1. Calls `fetch_prices` from `Trading signals/trading_signals.py` — same 5-year DB fetch used by the Trading Signals tab.
2. Calls `compute_rolling_signals` on the **full** 5-year history using the **quarterly-fixed β** approach:
   - β is estimated from a trailing 1-year (252-day) OLS, refreshed at each calendar-quarter boundary.
   - β is held constant for the entire quarter — no daily drift.
   - `window` controls only the z-score rolling mean/std (60–120 days, default 90).
   - The 4-year training window ensures every quarter in the test period has a fully calibrated β.
3. Slices the resulting DataFrame to `[test_start : test_end]` and returns both `(full_df, test_df)`.
4. No DB writes. No changes to other tabs.

**`identify_trades(df)`**
Groups consecutive non-zero `position_a` blocks into discrete trade records.
Handles mid-stream position flips (LONG→SHORT without an explicit EXIT signal).
Returns a DataFrame with `entry_date`, `exit_date`, `direction`, `holding_days`, `pnl`.

**`compute_halflife(spread)`**
Fits an AR(1) OLS on spread differences: `Δspread = γ · spread_{t-1} + ε`.
Half-life = `−ln(2) / γ`. Returns `nan` if the series is not mean-reverting (γ ≥ 0).

**`compute_all_metrics(test_df)`**
Master function that computes every metric the tab displays. Returns a single flat dict of scalars, Series, and DataFrames. Key sections:

| Section | Key metrics |
|---|---|
| Performance | Total PnL, annualized return %, Sharpe + label, quarterly Sharpe, rolling 30d/60d Sharpe, cumulative PnL, drawdown, max drawdown, Calmar + label, win rate, avg profit/trade, 5th/95th pct trade PnL |
| Trading activity | # trades, avg holding period, half-life + label, total turnover, Sharpe at 0/1/5/10 bps cost + strategy verdict |
| Risk | Ann. volatility, skewness, excess kurtosis, VaR 95%, CVaR 95%, max losing streak (days + value) |
| Stability | Rolling 60-day ADF p-value on spread, z-score histogram, quarterly-fixed β series (step-function chart + update count), rolling 60-day half-life series, std dev of trade PnL |
| Scalability | Metrics recomputed at 1×/2×/5× position size |

**Annualized return convention:** `mean(daily_pnl) × 252 / mean(price_a)` expressed as %. The mean price of stock A is used as the capital proxy (1 unit position size assumed throughout).

**Calmar ratio:** `ann_pnl_$ / |max_drawdown_$|` — both in dollar terms to keep the ratio consistent with the $ PnL framing of the rest of the strategy.

**Transaction cost sensitivity:** For each bps scenario, daily cost = `|Δposition_a| × price_a × bps/10000 + |Δposition_b| × price_b × bps/10000`. Sharpe is recomputed on cost-adjusted PnL.

## Changes to `app/streamlit_app.py`

1. **Added import** of `run_backtest`, `compute_all_metrics`, `get_split_dates` from `Backtest/backtest.py` via `sys.path.insert`.

2. **Removed Volatility tab** (`tab_vol`) from the `st.tabs()` call and deleted its `with tab_vol:` block entirely.

3. **Inserted Backtest tab** (`tab_test`) between Trading Signals and Daily PnL in the tab list.

4. **Backtest tab layout** (5 sections, shown after "Run Backtest" is clicked):
   - Section 1 — Performance: 6-metric top row, 5th/95th pct trade row, quarterly Sharpe table, rolling Sharpe chart, cumulative PnL + drawdown overlay chart.
   - Section 2 — Trading Activity: 4-metric row, cost-sensitivity table + verdict, trade log table.
   - Section 3 — Risk Metrics: 5-metric row (vol, skew, kurt, VaR, CVaR), max losing streak row.
   - Section 4 — Stability: 2×2 chart grid (rolling ADF p-value, z-score histogram, β series, rolling half-life) with std dev captions.
   - Section 5 — Scalability: text-only comparison of 2× and 5× vs baseline (Sharpe is scale-invariant so differences are only in $ metrics).

5. Results stored in `st.session_state["bt_result"]` — independent of the Trading Signals tab's `ts_df` state.

## Design decisions

- **Full 5-year warm-up, 1-year test slice:** Running signals on the full history before slicing avoids any "cold start" artifact during the test period. With quarterly β, each quarter's β requires 252 days of prior data; running on the full 5-year history ensures every quarter in the test window already has a calibrated β. This correctly simulates live deployment where the model has been running for 4 years before the test window starts.
- **No DB modifications:** The backtest is entirely in-memory. `fetch_prices` reads from the DB (read-only) and `compute_rolling_signals` is a pure function.
- **Capital proxy = mean(price_a):** Since position sizing is always ±1 unit of stock A, using the mean price of A over the test period as the capital denominator is a reasonable approximation for % return calculation.
- **Scalability section is text-only (per instruction):** Sharpe is mathematically scale-invariant (multiplying PnL by a constant leaves mean/std unchanged), so only absolute metrics (total PnL, max DD) change. This is surfaced as text rather than charts to avoid visual clutter.
